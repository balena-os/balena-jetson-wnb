                This brings in the aufs-to-overlay migrator. Which won't run
                until we

                configure the engine service to include an
                `BALENA_MIGRATE_OVERLAY=1`

                env var.


                The other notable change is the fix for

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/236 which
                allows

                `balena top` to work as expected on balenaOS

                modemmanager:u-blox-switch: Rework the u-blox modem switch to
                ECM mode

                We need to make sure the modem is completely initialized before
                sending

                the AT commands that do the switch to ECM mode. To achieve this
                we

                change the systemd service dependency to depend on
                ModemManager.service

                and then we determine the modem state by using mmcli and
                querying the

                modem power-state property.


                This procedure will only be done once. After the modem is placed
                in ECM

                mode, it will stay in this mode for future reboots so there will
                be no

                other delays in bringing up the modem connection.

                resin-mounts/etc-fake-hwclock: add dependency on resin-state
                services
              hash: 2b07011844a2738aec033d88af29e3f6e0dd28a2

                Added a dependency on resin-state.service and
                resin-state-reset.service

                to etc-fake-hwclock.mount.


                On initial boot after flashing a device the
                resin-state-reset.service

                was running after etc-fake-hwclock.mount causing the bind mount
                point

                /mnt/state/root-overlay/etc/fake-hwclock to be deleted after it
                had

                been mounted. This resulted in a failure to save the date/time
                at

                shutdown which caused problems with persistent logging at next
                boot.

                Subsequent boots are unaffected as resin-state-reset does not
                run.

                Adding a dependency on the resin-state services ensures that the

                bind mount point is created after the state reset has been
                performed.


                This issue was noticed when running the testbot unmanaged OS
                image

                persistent logging test. When running a managed OS image the
                device

                normally reboots fairly immediately after connecting to the

                balena-cloud host and receiving parameter updates, so this issue
                is

                not usually noticeable.

                At this moment resin_update_state_probe is scanning pretty much
                every

                block device for rootfs. This include ramdisks, zram and loop
                devices

                which, when scanned, even spam warnings in logs. This patch
                updates

                the udev rule to skip such devices and only trigger on add or
                change

                events.

              hash: 7983e9bfd716aaedad1ef5f1468b2771e1f5a71c
              body: >
                Previously we were loading the healthcheck image from it's own
                service

                that was previously made `PartOf=` the balena.service.

                This was done in an attempt to help get the system unstuck when
                the

                image is removed (like through manual pruning), which would
                cause the

                healthcheck to trigger the engine to reboot until the load
                service was

                restarted by hand.


                Further investigation found a race between the first execution
                of the

                engine healthcheck script (which needs the image to be loaded)
                and the

                loader service itself, which would lead to a similar state,
                requireing

                manual intervention.


                This change moves the loading into the healthcheck script
                itself,

                allowing us to remove the loader script and service entirely,
                skipping

                the whole service ordering issue.

              hash: 5e1004d6753025166c40b11af117e008feb875f1
              body: >
                grub-efi requires modules to be installed in the boot partition,
                and

                resin-image installs them from ${DEPLOYDIR}.


                A normal grub installation installs those modules to
                ${PREFIX}/${libdir}

                to allow grub tooling to install them at runtime, but we're
                building the

                image with GRUB baked in, so we don't need those in the sysroot.


                The first iteration of this bbappend attempted to solve these

                constraints by copying the modules from ${D}/${libdir}/grub/ to

                ${DEPLOYDIR} in do_deploy(), then removing ${D}${prefix}. This
                had the

                unfortunate side effect of breaking the build in certain cases,
                such as

                clean builds or reexecuting do_deploy() without the other steps
                of the

                build.


                Instead, remove the unwanted files in do_install(), and append
                the

                required modules to GRUB_BUILDIN to create a standalone grub
                image

                without any external modules at all.

                as UUID=xxx the waiting loop in rootfs initrd script would
                assume UUIDs have

                just been regenerated and wait for a by-state symlink instead.
                This only works

                for the OS - flasher does not use the dynamically generated
                UUIDs

                therefore we always want to use the by-uuid link for it.

              hash: 7d6ec3d411af78b9b1f979b90461e9efb059e4e7

                Replace the 'bind-etc-fake-hwclock.service' with a systemd mount

                unit (etc-fake\x2dhwclock.mount).


                Using a systemd service to bind mount the /etc/fake-hwclock
                directory

                results in systemd generating an internal mount unit for the
                same

                directory. This causes problems at shutdown when both methods
                try to

                unmount the directory. This frequently leads to the directory
                being

                unmounted before the fake-hwclock service has managed to save
                the

                system time. This results in an inaccurate fake-hwclock time

                at next boot and corruption of the journal log.

                We need to make sure the firmware cleanup function runs before

                do_populate_sysroot otherwise do_populate_sysroot will race with
                it and

                will fail complaining about the missing firmware that

                iwlwifi_firmware_clean had just deleted at the same time.

                Fixes #2075


                Needed were a number of various changes to make the package
                compile properly:


                Removed is
                0001-wwan-Set-MTU-based-on-what-ModemManager-exposes.patch that
                is now

                included upstream.


                Our patch for removing HTTPS connectivity checking warning is
                reworked for ease of

                maintainance. It now keeps the log entry, but changes it to
                debug level.


                Fixed are UPSTREAM_CHECK_* definitions as they referenced a
                wrong version number.


                The following additional configuration options were
                added/removed:


                *. Introspection is disabled through
                `--enable-introspection=no`. Other services do

                not depend on it, so it is safe to remove it. A related patch is
                no longer needed

                0002-Do-not-create-settings-settings-property-documentati.patch


                *. A new option for using firewalld zone for shared mode is
                disabled as we do not

                use firewalld.


                *. The polkit agent option no longer is available, so
                `--enable-polkit-agent` and

                `--disable-polkit-agent` are no longer defined.

                Replace busybox ps link with ps.procps without installing

                any other procps packages. This will avoid regression and bloat

                from swapping existing busybox links with procps variants.


                By using procps as docker expects we can properly handle ps args

                such as -e and -o to format output. Busybox is only capable of
                this

                when compiled in "desktop" mode.


                This upstream commit to poky has already split the ps binary
                into

                a separate procps package:


                -
                https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?id=507a47a4e5077d5f8f76d9629be6b871dfd8eb90


                So for now we can copy this recipe at the commit above into
                compat branches

                and use that version until we pick up a branch newer than
                gatesgarth.

              hash: e86c83e9be007bbedf5bad8bb961931c4f4f649c
              body: >
                Fixes #1846


                UART modems (RaspberryPi HATs) are not working currently under

                balenaOS as NetworkManager times out while attempting to
                establish

                ppp connection. This is not a balenaOS specific issue.


                This commits adds a `connect ""` declaration to
                `/etc/ppp/options`

                to workaround this as the NULL default value causes the timeout.


                The connect option specifies an external script to establish the

                physical link. When using NetworkManager/ModemManager it is

                ModemManager that establishes the physical link before passing
                it

                to NetworkManager. Thus `connect` should be empty.

                This is necessary because node has its own built-in CA bundle
                and ignores

                the system-wide bundle. Bind-mount the system-wide bundle to the
                supervisor

                container as well to keep the previous behavior. Make it
                read-only though,

                any modifications should be performed by the host OS.

                Remove the kernel-devsrc package from meta-balena and

                Initially I hoped thud and warrior could also use the respective
                upstreams but I see several differences between the meta-balena
                version and the upstreams so I updated those compat layers
                as well.

                The new version has enhancements and new features that will
                help to improve time synchronisation, including:

                - the ability to add server pools via scripts using chronyc.
                - support for dynamic NTP source files that can be reloaded
                  as necessary (useful for DHCP and config.json sources).
                - source name options for improved handling of pool addresses.
                - repeat 'iburst' when a source is changed from offline to
                  online state.

                the supervisor database was relocated by mistake. On this
                version the database

                returns to its original place, and these hooks copy the old
                database to the

                new location to avoid data loss.

                Ensure that the /var/log/supervisor-log directory exists prior
                to

                running 'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' as well as

                'runSupervisor'.


                Updates to the 'start-resin-supervisor' script in v2.62.1
                removed

                the check for updates to the REGISTRY_ENDPOINT variable.
                Previously

                this had been detected as changing every time the script was run

                due to a comparison between 'null' and ''. This resulted in the

                'start-resin-supervisor' script always running through the

                'runSupervisor' path. With this variable check removed, and no
                config

                updates being detected, the script was trying to run

                'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' and failing due to the

                absence of the /var/log/supervisor-log directory. To fix this
                problem we

                unconditionally test for and create this directory (if
                necessary) so

                that it is available regardless of the path taken through the
                script.

                Change the chrony UDP source port from 123 (privileged) to

                1234 (non-privileged).


                Previous issues with Phicomm routers had required the use of a
                fixed

                UDP source port, so port 123 was chosen as this is used by both
                ntpd

                and ntpdate. However recent testing has shown that using a
                privileged

                port such as 123 can cause issues on other networks. By changing
                the

                port to be non-privileged (i.e. 1234) we can satisfy both
                network

                requirements.

              hash: 1c1374f3c8b5914b7e645f8068ebafc8b4cbbe3a
              body: >
                The handling of the RTC at boot time has been improved as
                follows:


                1) A 'timeinit-rtc.sh' script has been added to improve logging
                of
                   system time updates from the RTC and to prevent system time
                   being set when RTC time is behind system time. If RTC time is
                   found to be behind system time a warning is issued regarding
                   potential RTC battery failure.

                2) The 'timeinit-rtc.service' has been added to the new systemd
                   'time-set.target'. This allows for better control and
                   co-ordination between the various time source services.

                3) Systemd dependencies have been updated to ensure that the
                   RTC is the final time service before the 'time-set.target'
                   is reached.

                The 'timeinit-buildtime.sh' script has been updated to use the

                new support functions provided by the 'os-helpers-time' script.

                        A docker-compose.yml with the following structure


                        ```

                        version: '2.1'

                        services:
                          app_1:
                            build: ./noisy-1
                            image: noisy1
                          app_2:

                        Will lead to the supervisor creating multiple image
                        database entries

                        with the same dockerId (this is because of how the
                        engine handles this

                        particular case). This case is not handled by the
                        removal process

                        leading to image pile up and increased disk usage.

                        The memory information reported by the supervisor
                        currently

                        estimates the value of used memory as `MemTotal -
                        MemFree`.

                        However, linux systems will try to cache and buffer as
                        much

                        memory as possible, which will affect the output of
                        `MemFree`

                        (from /proc/meminfo) and in consequence the memory usage
                        seen

                        by the user on the dashboard, which will appear much
                        greater than

                        it is.


                        The correct calculation should be `MemTotal - MemFree -
                        Buffers - Cached`,

                        which the calculation performed by `htop` and the `free`
                        commands.

                        When trying to apply SSDT overlays in Up Board, the
                        supervisor currently

                        gets stuck in a loop trying to apply target state. See
                        #1465


                        This was due to a bug in parsing the configuration,
                        which lead to

                        the method bootConfigChangeRequired returning true when
                        no change was

                        needed.

                        Each service, when requesting access to the Supervisor
                        API, will

                        now get an individual key which can be scoped to
                        specific resources.

                        In this iteration the default scope will be to the
                        application that

                        the service belongs to.


                        We also have a `global` scope which is used by the cloud
                        API when in

                        managed mode.

                By default chrony uses a random UDP source port for each NTP
                request.

                This can cause problems with particular routers/firewalls
                (issues have

                been reported for the Phicomm KE 2P).


                The chrony `acquisitionport` configuration setting has been
                added

                to the chrony.conf file to change the UDP source port for NTP
                requests

                to 123 (this is the same as the default source port used by both

                ntpdate and ntpd).

                Drop the '-s' command line parameter from chronyd as:

                a) restoring time from the drift file is no longer necessary due
                to

                the fake-hwclock service, and

                b) restoring time from the RTC is already covered by the
                timeinit-rtc

                service.

                systemd/timeinit: add fake.hwclock to maintain system time over
                reboots
              hash: 96c2c495819ba6175261a5179e1cdb4673552e6c
              body: >
                In order to produce sensible timestamps for journald log
                messages:

                a) the system time needs to be maintained correctly over a
                reboot, and

                b) the system time needs to be set before journald is started.


                Currently the system time is maintained over reboots on systems

                without an RTC using the last modified time of the chrony drift
                file.

                However there are a couple of issues with this approach:


                a) /var/lib/chrony/ is not mounted early enough in the boot
                process

                to be available for setting the time before journald is started.

                b) there is an issue with the current systemd dependencies that
                result

                in the last modified time of the drift file not being updated
                when the

                system is shutdown or rebooted (see #1995).


                The Debian fake-hwclock service (as used by Raspberry Pi OS) has
                been

                added to overcome these issues.


                The fake-hwclock service will save and restore the system time
                from

                the fake-hwclock.data file (in /etc/fake-hwclock/). The system
                time

                is loaded from this file at boot and saved to it on shutdown. An

                additional timer service has been added to update the file on an

                hourly basis to cater for unexpected shutdown scenarios, e.g.
                power

                failure.


                The timeinit-timestamp service has improved logging and has been

                renamed to timeinit-buildtime for clarity.


                A new time-set.target has been added as per upstream systemd and

                the fake-hwclock and timeinit-buildtime services have been added

                to it.

                extensions

                in the system.


                The list of hostapp extensions to install can either be passed
                to the

                script or it will use the ones set in config.json or
                hostapp-extensions.conf

                in that order.

                Host extension images contain extra content that is overlayed
                over the

                This commits adds the default host extensions to the data
                partition

                image, stores their repository tags in the /etc directory, and
                creates

                the containers so that mobynit can mount the container
                filesystems on

                boot.

                support host

                extensions, the runtime systemd-udev no longer sees the
                resin-data mount

                event and this mount is blocked.


                This is resolved by not adding the default dependency on the
                block device.

                This only applies to the host configuration files which are the
                only ones

                that force a reboot.

            - subject: Wait for the root device to come up when necessary
              hash: 494eeb4a699b4dd5e48547d6e5e45cffb7bf0720
              body: >
                If the rootfs is on a slow-to-bring-up device (e.g. RPi4 + USB)

                the fsuuidsinit_enabled() function may return before the balena
                symlinks

                are created. This gets wrongly interpreted as missing UUIDs
                leading to

                a chain of failures in the subsequent scripts.

                This patch moves the symlink waiting loop from fsuuidsinit_run()

                to fsuuids_enabled() before the first usage of the symlink.

            - subject: Respect balenaRootCA system-wide
              hash: 2218cb21d1fc813ac59c08b77046c5d014ad9a42
              body: >
                We allow the user to specify a custom CA in the .balenaRootCA
                key

                of config.json but at this moment each tool has to implement
                support

                if it wants to use it. This commit adds it to the system-wide CA
                bundle

                so that the CA is respected everywhere.


                Fixes #1398

                        manually resolves the names.

                                The change type is considered 'major' because,
                                by default, errors are

                                now thrown for relatively common occurrences
                                such as authentication

                                failures when pulling from private registries,
                                and library users may

                                have to adapt.

                                        This is a hack, and should be reverted
                                        once we get to the bottom of it.

                                        It will impact performance, but right
                                        now there are things that should

                                        be filtered and are not, so lets get
                                        this merged for security purposes.

                                        Hopefully this library will be
                                        re-written soon.

                Recently the supervisor added a codepath that assumes no files
                underneath it will change during runtime.

                OS update hooks can trigger a condition whereby the supervisor
                reboots the device during a HUP,

                which in turn bricks the device.


                Additionally, since unknown args cause this update to
                fail-closed,

                remove that barrier to future-proof more flag expansion.

                On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the
                supervisor moved

                from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit
                creation of

                directories instead of files.


                However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory,
                these have

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create
                them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the
                /var/log/supervisor-log

                directory and creates it if required.

                In rocko, systemd kills any script started in background,
                same thing happening to children that get re-parented.

                One solution to this is to use a separate service file for
                starting the healtcheck image load script, after balena.service
                was started.

                Otherwise, as util-linux has a higher default alternative
                priority, the

                version in util-linux is chosen. It would seem they are
                exchangeable, but

                the busybox version reportedly works even if the RTC interrupt
                line is not

                connected.

                On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the
                supervisor moved

                from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit
                creation of

                directories instead of files.


                However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory,
                these have

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create
                them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the
                /resin-data/resin-supervisor

                directory and creates it if required.

                When performing hostOS updates, the resin-logo.png might have

                This commits renames it to the newly branded balena-logo.png


                If the resin-logo.png was unmodified, it will forcefully replace
                to

                balena-logo.png to force rebranding of older resin branded
                release.

                The `docker` Docker Hub repository lists what versions of the
                image

                are supported and 18.6 is not among them at all. Use the current
                stable

                line of 18.09 instead, to stay on supported versions. See more
                info at:

                https://hub.docker.com/_/docker


                For more reproducability, we are also including the patch level
                version

                of the container, which will give us more responsibility to
                update more

                frequently, but fewer surprises.


                Also explicitly set `DOCKER_HOST` for the daemon being started,
                otherwise

                the base image's setting might silently take over, and modify
                this.


                Replace deprecated `-g` (graph driver) with `--data-root` as
                well.

                resin-init has a hardcoded command to disable power management

                on wlan0. This commit moves the logic to udev rule as there is

                no guarantee wlan0 is the only or default wlan adapter in the
                system.


                There seems to be no better way to identify a wlan device in
                udev

                than KERNEL=="wl*" which should match both net.ifnames=0 (wlanX)

                and net.ifnames=1 (wlpX).
